# MateBook-X-Pro-2019-Hackintosh-ENG/DE

### Project to change the operating System of your Matebook X Pro from Windows to macOS

This is a project to set up a Hackintosh. This project stands out from the others because it is exclusively the 2019 MateBook X pro. This is an open community project I will be here to build the basic information and data to build a hackintosh. This site is still in its infancy. If there are problems or questions with the project please open a new problem in the problem tab of this page.

## Important information and compatibility
My current Hackintosh system is the model: MACH-W19 and has the Official BIOS on version 1.30
The system is currently compatible with the following macOS versions:
- macOS Mojave – 10.14 (full Software)
- macOS Catalina – 10.15 (inkl. all little Updates)
- macOS Big Sur – 11.0.1 (in development)

## WARNING 
If you follow this guide please do the steps exactly as they stand there. In the event of errors or damage, I do not accept any responsibility. Installing Apple's own software on other NOT APPLE DEVICES is prohibited and should therefore be used ONLY for your own use. For this reason, there will be no full software for download here, but only the instructions on how and where to get it from. If you have any problems or questions, I'm happy to be open and hope that this project will help a few people understand the installation of other systems and get to know bootloaders. Information to form myself I have linked from the very good explanation of profzei's instructions (at the end of the page)

## Ready to start? 
From here the installation starts you will be forwarded [here](https://github.com/Okto-Cat/MateBook-X-Pro-2019-Hackintosh-ENG-DE/wiki) to the wiki and can start the preparations. Have fun and thank you for following this guide. :)
